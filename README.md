**quince** is a drum machine toy inspired by http://emberbeats.gavinjoyce.com. Some of the logic, and one of the song presets (a favorite of mine), is the borrowed from that app.
This app is in its MVP form and is, admittedly, janky. I hope you enjoy it regardless.

**Learning Objectives:**

Among my learning objectives for **quince** was to get a handle on React's `useReducer` hook, which makes more sense than Redux for a project this small (and which, rather happily, feels like writing Elm :D).

**Todo:**

* Per-channel mute button
* More presets!
* More drumkits!
* Code organization (may refactor to use context api)
* Clearer, friendlier UI
* More attractive styling (including icons)
* More responsive layout
* Performance considerations
* Super duper stretch goal: drumkit builder
